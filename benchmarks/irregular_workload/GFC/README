3. Compile
1.1 -- nvcc -O3 GFC_11.cu -o GFC
2.1 -- nvcc -O3 -arch=sm_20 GFC_21.cu -o GFC

4. Run
Compress: ./GFC (#blocks) (#warps/block) (#dim) < the input file > (outputfile)
Example: 
    To compress the file file.in using 28 blocks and 18 warps/block with a dimensionality of 2 and store the result in a file called file.gfc, enter:
./GFC 28 18 2 < file.in > file.gfc

Decompress: ./GFC < input file >  (outputfile)
Example:
To decompress the file file.gfc and store the result in file file.out, enter:
./GFC < file.gfc > file.out


Note that the raw data file has to be a multiple of 8 bytes long and should contain nothing but binary double-precision values. Only little-endian systems are currently supported.
