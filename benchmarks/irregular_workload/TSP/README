3.Compile
nvcc -O3 -arch=sm_20 TSP_GPU.cu -o TSP_GPU

4.Run
TSP_GPU11 Example:
The executable approximately solves the traveling salesman problem represented by the input TSPLIB database using x climbers. The minimal found tour length is printed to the standard output.
To solve the TSPLIB 18512-city database d18512.tsp using 52 climbers (random restarts), enter:
./TSP_GPU21 d18512.tsp 52

TSP_GPU21 Example: 
The executable approximately solves the traveling salesman problem represented by the input TSPLIB database using x climbers. The minimal tour and its cost are printed to the standard output.
To solve the TSPLIB 100-city database kroA100.tsp using 100,000 climbers, enter:
./TSP_GPU kroA100.tsp 100000
